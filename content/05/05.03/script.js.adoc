Let's look at the two scenarios that illustrate the rule about range again shot::[1,"show the range rule & scenarios"]. Notice how the steps that create the Sean,shot::[2] Lucy,shot::[3] and Larry shot::[4] are very similar.

When we see steps like this, Gherkin’s Given When Then syntax starts to feel a bit clunky. Imagine if we could just write out a table, like this:

shot::[5,feature file]

.hear_shout.feature
[source,gherkin]
----
include::../code/js/05-location-specified-in-data-table/features/hear_shout.feature[lines=17..20]
----

Well, we’re in luck. You can!

Gherkin has a special syntax called Data Tables, that allows you to specify tabular data for a step, using pipe characters to mark the boundary between cells.shot::[6, highlight data table]

shot::[7,"run cucumber"]shot::[8,"copy snippet, paste into steps.rb"]

.steps.js
[source,js]
----
include::../code/js/06-table-snippet-added/features/step_definitions/steps.js[lines=25..28]
----

As you can see, the step definition implicitly takes a single argument shot::[9,"highlight stepdef parameters"], which is a DataTable. This object has a rich API for using the tabular data.

At its most basic, the table is just a two-dimensional array. So, Lucy's location can be accessed shot::[10,"Print out a single cell value"] by getting the value from array cell (2, 1)

.steps.js
[source,js]
----
include::../code/js/07-use-datatable-raw-to-demonstrate-2d-array/features/step_definitions/steps.js[lines=25..27]
----

shot::[11,"run Cucumber, highlight 'Lucy's location'"]

You can also turn the table into a array of objects shot::[12,"Print out data table as hashes"], where the first row is used for the property names,shot::[13,"split IntelliJ screen horizontally, showing feature file at top and stepdefs below. Highlight first row"] and each following row is used for the property values.shot::[14, "highlight second and third rows"]

.steps.js
[source,js]

include::../code/js/08-table-as-hashes/features/step_definitions/steps.js[lines=25..27]
----

shot::[15,"run Cucumber, highlight data table output"]

Now we can easily iterate shot::[16,"write the loop"] over these maps and turn them into instances of Person: shot::[17]

include::../code/js/09-iterate-over-people-in-table/features/step_definitions/steps.js[lines=25..29]
----

shot::[18,"run cucumber -- all green"]

With that done, we can update the other scenario shot::[19,"update other scenario"] ...

.hear_shout.feature
[source,gherkin]
----
include::../code/java/10--step10-changed-other-scenario-and-deleted-unused-stepdef/shouty/src/test/resources/shouty/hear_shout.feature[lines=24..31]
----

Now we can check that everything is still green. shot::[20]

... and delete our old step definition shot::[21,"delete unused step def"], which is now unused.

.steps.js
[source,js]
----
include::../code/js/09-iterate-over-people-in-table/features/step_definitions/steps.js[lines=21..23]
----

shot::[22,"run cucumber"]

Cucumber strips all the white space surrounding each cell shot::[23,"show lining up of pipe characters"], so we can have a nice neat table in the Gherkin but still get clean values in the step definition underneath.


That looks much nicer - shot::[24,"hear_shout.feature data tables"] people positioned using a table in the feature file and shot::[25,"people_are_located_at()"] really clean code that creates and positions people according to the data.
