One common example is the problem of plurals. Suppose we want to place Lucy and Sean just 1 metre apart:

[source, gherkin]
----
include::../code/dotnet/03--step03-use-singular-metre/Shouty/Shouty.Specs/Features/HearShout.feature[lines=4]
----

shot::[2, "Show test results and open test output"]
Because weâ€™ve used the singular `metre` instead of the plural `metres` we don't get a match:

[source]
----
Given Lucy is located 1 metre from Sean
-> No matching step definition found for the step. Use the following code to create one:
        [Given(@"Lucy is located (.*) metre from Sean")]
        public void GivenLucyIsLocatedMetreFromSean(int p0)
        {
            _scenarioContext.Pending();
        }
----

What a pain!

Fear not. We can just surround the `s` in parentheses to make it optional, like this: shot::[3]

[source, c#]
----
include::../code/dotnet/04--step04-allow-for-singular-or-plural-metres/Shouty/Shouty.Specs/StepDefinitions/StepDefinitions.cs[lines=14..15]
----

shot::[4, "Run tests and show test result"]
Now our step matches:

[source]
----
System.NotImplementedException : Lucy is 100 centimetres from Sean
----

This is one way to smooth off some of the rough edges in your cucumber expressions, and allow your scenarios to be as expressive as possible.

Another is to allow _alternates_ - different ways of saying the same thing. For example, to accept this step: shot::[5]

[source, gherkin]
----
include::../code/dotnet/05--step05-allow-standing-or-located-as-alternates/Shouty/Shouty.Specs/Features/HearShout.feature[lines=4]
----

...we can use this Cucumber Expression: shot::[6]

[source, c#]
----
include::../code/dotnet/05--step05-allow-standing-or-located-as-alternates/Shouty/Shouty.Specs/StepDefinitions/StepDefinitions.cs[lines=14..15]
----

shot::[7, "build and show 'go to definition'"]
Now we can use either 'standing' or 'located' in our scenarios, and both will match just fine as you can see...
