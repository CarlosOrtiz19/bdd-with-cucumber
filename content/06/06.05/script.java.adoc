shot::[1, show HTML output]
In the last lesson we saw the output generated by the HTML plugin. This is a great way for your business colleagues and customers to watch the development of the product. Since the scenarios are written in business language, they act as documentation that everyone interested in the product can understand. And, because the results are colour-coded green (if the system behaves as expected) or red (if it doesn't) everyone can see what behaviour has been implemented.

The challenge is making sure that this documentation is easily available. Feature files are usually checked into source control along with the source code, which isn't a great way of making it accessible to less technical team members. The HTML output could be shared, but it needs to be stored somewhere that everyone has access to - such as on your intranet or wiki. That's something that your team will have to configure themselves.

Since Cucumber-JVM 6.6.0 there has been a new feature that allows you to automatically publish the results online to a free service called Cucumber Reports. shot::[1, go to reports.cucumber.io]

Ensure that you're using Cucumber-JVM 6.6.0 or later shot::[1, show pom.xml file] and run Cucumber. shot::[1, run Cucumber]. Cucumber helpfully prints out a banner telling you how to publish your results to Cucumber Reports shot::[1, highlight banner].

Let's follow the instructions from the Cucumber Reports website and set `cucumber.publish.enabled` to `true` shot::[]. Now we can run Cucumber again and we get a different banner output shot:[]. The unique URL in this banner is the address of your published report shot::[1, highlight URL].

shot::[1, follow URL]
Open the URL and you'll find your report published in the same format as the HTML plugin. but now you can share the report just by sharing the URL. You also get some extra information about the run that generated the report.

//CLAIM
You might have noticed the warning in the banner that says the report will be deleted after 24 hours unless claimed or deleted. shot::[1, highlight warning] This is because the report you just published can be read by anyone who gets access to the URL. It's a hard-to-guess URL, but security through obscurity isn't secure enough.
